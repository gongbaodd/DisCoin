[Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/discoin-crypto-bubble-simulator-5)

***Editor version 6.0.34f1***

Step into the dark world of crypto speculation as a "crypto bro" trying to ride the wave of disinformation and manipulate the market. In DisCoin, you'll select news stories, spin lies, approve, or dismiss them to sway public opinion, keeping your memecoin value afloat.

Your choices impact trust and the sanity of your user base. Will you push outrageous lies to skyrocket the price, or play it safe with smaller truths? With every click, the coin value fluctuates. Maintain the perfect bubble and rake in millions before running away, or watch it burst and face the consequences.

Featuring a glowing screen ambiance, GPU fans whirring, and frantic decision-making, DisCoin challenges you to keep the bubble aliveâ€”or pop it. Can you master the game of deception, or will your memecoin crash to zero?
